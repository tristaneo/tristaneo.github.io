# Current Research Projects
## Charcoal Production
In this project we aim to detect charcoal production across Mozambique using Sentinel 1 SAR using 1D Neural Networks. We support European software developed though the use of the EuroDataCube and code the project in Python.
## Characterising Persistance in European Vegitation
We aim to characterise persistance in European vegitation as result of extreme events.
